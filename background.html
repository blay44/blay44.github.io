 				<p>To most the question, "Where are you from?" is very straight forward. For me, it is not as simple. At just the age of five I moved from my small town in Westminster, Colorado, across the globe to tropical Singapore. Little did I know that I would spend majority of my life there and quickly become accustomed to living in Asia as an American expatriate. As a kindergartener, I attended the Singapore American School, the largest American school in Singapore, and I later graduated High School from S.A.S. in 2010. Quite frequently I have to endure the long 18-hour flight to Singapore, where my parents still reside.</p>

				<p>Most people know little to nothing about Singapore besides the "fact" that you cannot chew gum in the country, which is actually not true. While you can bring gum into the country and chew it, domestic selling of gum is prohibited. Singapore is located right off the tip of Malaysia, only 85 miles north of the equator. Being in this central location in Asia allowed me to travel to places that I would have never had the opportunity to travel to before, ranging from Bali to Australia.  While I lived in Singapore the local economy boomed, and I was able to experience the economic growth first hand. Boston Consulting Group recently named Singapore the country with the world's densest population of millionaires, with 17 percent of all households over the million-dollar USD mark. Not so prestigiously, Singapore quickly passed London and Tokyo to become the most expensive country to live in. To put it in perspective, the average car costs more than $152,000 to buy (thanks to the exorbitant licensing fees) and housing rent ranges from $7k to $24k per month. Overall, my experience growing up in Singapore was truly priceless, and I would highly recommend visiting if given the opportunity.</p>

 				<p>In 2000, my father's job again took me to an extraordinary location. I was fortunate enough to move to the bustling city of Hong Kong. When I first arrived, I was shocked as to how much Hong Kong was comparable to New York but with an Asian twist. Time Magazine best describes the comparison when they coined the phrase "Nylonkong", which referred to New York City, London and Hong Kong's key role in the global economy. Being on Chinaâ€™s south coast, the massive city is well known for its expansive skyline and gigantic harbor. One of my favorite activities was taking the Star Ferry across the harbor at night to Victoria Peak, the highest peak on Hong Kong Island. The famous night-time attraction on the peak was a massive lightshow and laser display, called the Symphony of Lights, featuring intricate exterior displays across 45 buildings on both sides of the Victoria Harbor of Hong Kong accompanied by music.</p>

 				<p>I lived in Hong Kong for a total of three years. In 2003 the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, broke out and quickly spread from Hong Kong to 37 countries in the surrounding area. My school temporarily shut down for precautionary reasons, and I was forced to finish my 5th grade taking online courses. Unfortunately, my parents decided that it was best for me to finish my middle school education in the United States because of the SARS outbreak. However, when I would later move back to Singapore for high school, I traveled many times to Hong Kong to visit my old friends.</p>

				<p>Recently, I was given the opportunity to again live abroad through the University of Miami's study abroad program. I chose to study in Amsterdam, the Dutch capital, at the Hogeschool Van Amsterdam School of Economics. There, I gained great insight into the European perspective on the recent economic crisis of 2008. I was blessed with the opportunity to live on the famous Prinsengracht, just a few blocks from Dam Square and one block over from the Anne Frank House.<p>

				<p>The most beautiful part of the city is the flow of canals that run throughout Dam Square. In 2012, Amsterdam was ranked the 2nd best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). A majority of the Dutch daily commute is done via bicycle because everything is just a stone throw away from the city center. It was amazing being able to travel this way during the warm summer and fall season, but I was quick to change my mind when I was forced to trek to school in the snow during the winter. Besides the historical attractions, such as the Van Gogh museum and the Anne Frank House, there is the infamous Red Light District and various coffee shops scattered throughout Dam Square. Unfortunately many people have a preconceived notion about Amsterdam, but it would come to their surprise that only a slim percent of the local population partake in the taboo activities. I would recommend everybody to one day visit Amsterdam before they pass judgment on the amazing city.</p>
